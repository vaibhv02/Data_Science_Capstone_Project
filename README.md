# SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction Capstone

## Introduction

In this capstone project, we aim to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of 62 million dollars, while other providers charge upwards of 165 million dollars. Much of SpaceX's cost savings are due to the reusability of the first stage. Therefore, by predicting the likelihood of a successful landing, we can estimate the cost of a launch. This information can be invaluable for alternate companies looking to bid against SpaceX for rocket launches.

## Project Structure

### Module 1: Introduction
- Overview of the problem
- Tools needed for the course

### Module 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Collecting data on Falcon 9 first-stage landings using a RESTful API and web scraping
- Converting data into a dataframe and performing data wrangling

### Module 3: Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboard
- Building a dashboard to analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash
- Creating an interactive map to analyze launch site proximity using Folium

### Module 4: Predictive Analysis (Classification)
- Using machine learning to predict the success of Falcon 9 first stage landings
- Splitting data into training and test sets
- Hyperparameter tuning for SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression
- Evaluating the performance of different models on test data to find the best approach

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12.1
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, dash, folium, scikit-learn, beautifulsoup4, requests
